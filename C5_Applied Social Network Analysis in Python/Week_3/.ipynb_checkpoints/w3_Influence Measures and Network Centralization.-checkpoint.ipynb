    "**you will explore ways of measuring the importance or centrality of a node in a network. You will cover several different centrality measures including Degree, Closeness, and Betweenness centrality, Page Rank, and Hubs and Authorities. You will learn about the assumptions each measure makes, the algorithms we can use to compute them, and the different functions available on NetworkX to measure centrality. You will also compare the ranking of nodes by centrality produced by the different measures. In the assignment, you will practice choosing the most appropriate centrality measure on a real-world setting, where you are tasked with choosing a person from a social network who should be given a promotional voucher in order to maximize the impact of the promotion on the network.**"

    "So, we'll say that the degree centrality of a node V is going to be the ratio between its degree and the number of nodes in the graph minus one. So, in this case a node would have a centrality of one if it's connected to every single node in the network and a centrality of zero if it's connected to no node in the network. And so, this measure goes between zero and one, with one being the case where you're most connected.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- And so, the way we're going to define the closeness centrality of node V is going to be by taking the ratio of the number of nodes in the network minus one divided by the sum over all the other nodes in the network, and the distance between node V and those nodes. So, that's the sum and the denominator in the definition of centrality.\n",

    "- `First option`:  we can simply only consider the nodes that L can actually reach in order to measure its closeness centrality. So, the way this would work is that we define this set R(L) to be the set of nodes that L can actually reach and we define the closeness centrality of L to be the ratio of the number of nodes that L can reach divided by the sum of the distances from L to all the nodes that L can actually reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- And so, for node L here, this would be simply one, because L can only reach node M so R(L) here is just the set M is just the node M and L can reach M in just one step. So, the closeness centrality of L here, would be one over one.\n",
    "![14](14.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `In option 2`: we again only consider the nodes that L can reach, but then, we normalize by the fraction of nodes that L can reach. So, the way this looks here is that when we compute the closeness centrality of L, we have the same ratio of R(L) over the sum. But now, we're going to multiply that ratio, the fraction of nodes that L can reach, R(L), divided by the number of nodes in the graph minus one. So basically, we're normalizing by the fraction of nodes that L can reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- And so, if L cannot reach many nodes we're going to be multiplying these other fraction by a very small number. And so, in this case if we do that we find that L has a closeness centrality of 0. 071 which is more reasonable than defined to be one.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Note here`\n",
    "- That in this new definition when we're normalizing, we're not changing the definition of closeness centrality when the graph is connected, where in every node can reach every other node. That's because when that's the case R(L) for node L would equal M minus one and this formula that you see here would be the exact same formula that we had before. So, we're not changing the definition. This definition can still apply even if the graph is completely connected. \n",
